@article{Guay2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article is to summarize all episodes of local anesthetic-related methemoglobinemia found in the medical literature. METHODS: I performed a search of the American National Library of Medicine's PubMed with the following key words: "local anesthetic" and "methemoglobinemia." RESULTS: Two-hundred-forty-two episodes (40.1\% published in year 2000 or after) were found. Chocolate-colored blood suggests methemoglobinemia but other colors may be found. A discrepancy between the pulse oximeter saturation (< or = 90\%) and the arterial oxygen partial pressure (> or = 70 mm Hg) was present in 91.8\% of the episodes. The difference between oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry and co-oximetry varied from -6.2\% to 44.7\%. Plain prilocaine may induce clinically symptomatic methemoglobinemia in children older than 6 mo at doses exceeding 2.5 mg/kg. In adults, the dose of prilocaine should be kept lower than 5.0 mg/kg, which is reduced to 3.2 mg/kg in the presence of renal insufficiency and to 1.3 mg/kg if other oxidizing drugs are used concurrently. A single spray of benzocaine may induce methemoglobinemia. Clinical symptoms may be observed at relatively low methemoglobin values, including coma at 32.2 and 29.1\% in children and adults, respectively. Rebound methemoglobinemia (benzocaine on mucous membranes) with methemoglobin values as high as 59.9\% may occur up to 18 h after methylene blue administration. Complications of methemoglobinemia include hypoxic encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, and death. CONCLUSION: Benzocaine should no longer be used. Prilocaine should not be used in children younger than 6-mo-old, in pregnant women, or in patients taking other oxidizing drugs. The dose should be limited to 2.5 mg/kg.},

abstract = {As carbon monoxide (CO) toxicity may present with non-specific signs and symptoms and without history of exposure, screening for CO toxicity may identify occult cases. The objective of this study was to determine whether non-invasive screening for CO exposure could be performed in all patients presenting to a high-volume urban emergency department (ED) and would identify patients with unsuspected CO toxicity. A study of adult patients, who presented to the ED for any complaint, prospectively screened for carboxyhemoglobin concentration by a pulse CO-oximeter (SpCO). ED triage staff recorded SpCO on the patient's chart at triage. Data, including SpCO and vital signs, were recorded in a database by two trained research assistants. When available, carboxyhemoglobin concentration obtained by venous blood was also included in the data set. There were 14,438 patients who presented to the ED and were entered in the study. Data from 10,856 (75\%) patients receiving screening for SpCO were analyzed. Patients were 44 +/- 19 years old and 51\% female; 32\% of the patients smoked. The mean SpCO was 5.17\% +/- 3.78\% among smokers and 2.90\% +/- 2.76\% among non-smokers. During the study period, 11 patients with presenting signs and symptoms not consistent with CO toxicity were identified through SpCO screening. Screening for CO toxicity using a non-invasive pulse CO-oximeter can be conducted even in a busy tertiary center ED and identify patients with occult CO toxicity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: While carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is common in the USA, its incidence is uncertain. Fatal poisonings are counted with relative accuracy from death certificate data, but estimates of the more common nonfatal poisonings are either old or limited. This study was performed to estimate the number of emergency department (ED) visits annually in the USA for carbon monoxide poisoning. BASIC PROCEDURES: ED visit rates in five states (Idaho, Maine, Montana, Utah, and Washington) from three prior studies, each using different methodology, were used to extrapolate independent estimates of national ED visits. MAIN FINDINGS: After correcting for regional differences in CO poisoning incidence, estimates of national ED visits per year ranging from 32,413 to 56,037 were obtained. Excluding the estimate derived from the Maine rate because it did not include intentional and fire-related poisonings, the national average is 50,558 +/- 4,843 visits per year. CONCLUSIONS: There are approximately 50,000 ED visits for CO poisoning in the USA annually, 3-5 times the numbers previously estimated. As this disease can result in significant long-term morbidity even when treated, enhanced prevention efforts are warranted.},

abstract = {Maximizing the laboratory setting for testing baseline pulse oximetry accuracy in an arterial desaturation study requires a study design that considers management of several aspects in the physiology of the test subject, special attention to the device under test, and great care in the preanalytical (sample handling) and analytical (Co-oximeter) phases. Statistics used to describe the resulting SpO2 performance include Precision (size of the data cloud), Bias (offset of the data cloud), and A(rms) (accuracy root mean square), which combines the size and offset of the data cloud in one number. The A(rms) is the primary statistic required by regulatory organizations to describe general performance over the entire saturation range. It does not describe any one point, but is a compilation of all points over the range tested. Most pulse oximeters in use today specify an A(rms) of 2\%. To meet this specification, two-thirds of the readings will be within 2\% of the Co-oximeter reference; however, some individual readings can be as inaccurate as 6\% or more. The A(rms) statistic does not have the capacity to represent all pulse oximeter behavior. Saturation pop-ups, drop-downs, frozen readings, and periods of no reading are not portrayed by the A(rms). The next steps in the advancement of regulatory validation testing would be to develop standards that include an expanded analysis of pulse oximeter performance by assessment of pop-ups, dropouts, frozen readings, and periods of no reading through assessment of sensitivity/specificity and possibly a "Performance Index" similar to the approach taken by Barker.},

abstract = {Noninvasive methods of body fluid chemical measurement have been expanding. New technologies are enabling the quantification of different compounds in the blood and interstitial tissues. One example of this is the pulse oximeter, which has facilitated the measurement of oxyhemoglobin rapidly and reliably without the requirement of blood-draws. The Masimo Rad-57 Pulse CO-Oximeter expanded the capabilities of pulse-oximetry to include measurements of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. This innovation has revolutionized the paradigm for detection of patients with CO poisoning. Previously, clinicians relied on historical information and patient signs and symptoms pointing to the possibility of CO exposure or toxicity. Only then would a blood test be ordered to measure carboxyhemoglobin levels. Since the presentation of CO poisoning is nonspecific and overlaps with many other conditions, and since the presence of environmental CO is often unknown, the detection of this condition was only possible in cases where the presence of CO was obvious or where the symptoms were severe. We now know, from studies conducted using the Rad-57, the only US FDA-approved device for noninvasive measurement of SpCO, that there are a significant number of patients who experience CO exposure but are nonsymptomatic. The Rad-57 provides a clinical justification for screening in the healthcare setting to identify patients with significant CO exposure who would otherwise be undetected.},

abstract = {In this article, I examine the source of the photoplethysmograph (PPG), as well as methods of investigation, with an emphasize on amplitude, rhythm, and pulse analysis. The PPG waveform was first described in the 1930s. Although considered an interesting ancillary monitor, the "pulse waveform" never underwent intensive investigation. Its importance in clinical medicine was greatly increased with the introduction of the pulse oximeter into routine clinical care in the 1980s. Its waveform is now commonly displayed in the clinical setting. Active research efforts are beginning to demonstrate a utility beyond oxygen saturation and heart rate determination. Future trends are being heavily influenced by modern digital signal processing, which is allowing a re-examination of this ubiquitous waveform. Key to unlocking the potential of this waveform is an unfettered access to the raw signal, combined with standardization of its presentation, and methods of analysis. In the long run, we need to learn how to consistently quantify the characteristics of the PPG in such a way as to allow the results from research efforts be translated into clinically useful devices.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning can be difficult because the symptoms are nonspecific and may mimic other illnesses. If carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected, the standard test at this time is venous or arterial carboxyhemoglobin levels. A new device, the Rad-57 pulse CO-oximeter (Masimo Inc.), can measure carboxyhemoglobin levels non-invasively at emergency department triage. METHODS: The pulse CO-oximeter was utilized in our emergency department triage to measure carboxyhemoglobin levels on all patients. A retrospective chart review was then conducted to identify all patients with elevated levels. CASE SERIES: Out of an estimated 74,880 patients who had their SpCO measured and documented at triage, seven patients who presented with vague complaints were diagnosed with occult carbon monoxide poisoning. Their diagnosis was facilitated by the non-invasive pulse CO-oximeter, which measured their carboxyhemoglobin levels when the standard vital signs were also documented at triage. CONCLUSIONS: The non-invasive pulse CO-oximeter could be a major triage tool for identifying unsuspected carbon monoxide poisoning among patients with nonspecific symptoms.},

abstract = {In the 1930s and 1940s, photo cells permitted German, English, and American physiologists to construct ear oximeters with red and infrared light, requiring calibration. In 1940 Squire recognized that changes of red and infrared light transmission caused by pneumatic tissue compression permitted saturation to be computed. In 1949 Wood used this idea to compute absolute saturation continuously from the ratios of optical density changes with pressure in an ear oximeter. In 1972 Takuo Aoyagi, an electrical engineer at Nihon Kohden company in Tokyo, was interested in measuring cardiac output noninvasively by the dye dilution method using a commercially available ear oximeter. He balanced the red and infrared signals to cancel the pulse noise which prevented measuring the dye washout accurately. He discovered that changes of oxygen saturation voided his pulse cancellation. He then realized that these pulsatile changes could be used to compute saturation from the ratio of ratios of pulse changes in the red and infrared. His ideas, equations and instrument were adapted, improved and successfully marketed by Minolta about 1978, stimulating other firms to further improve and market pulse oximeters worldwide in the mid 1980s. Dr. Aoyagi and associates provided a detailed history for this paper.},

abstract = {Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that does not bind oxygen. When its concentration is elevated in red blood cells, functional anemia and tissue hypoxia may occur. We performed a retrospective case series to describe the cases of acquired methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin level >2\%) detected and the clinical circumstances under which they occurred at 2 tertiary care hospitals and affiliated outpatient clinics over 28 months. We surveyed co-oximetry laboratory data to identify patients with methemoglobinemia. We reviewed these patients' medical records to extract the clinical information and context. One hundred thirty-eight cases of acquired methemoglobinemia were detected over the 28 months. There was no gender predisposition, and the condition occurred over a wide range of ages (patients aged 4 days to 86 years). Cases occurred in many areas of the hospital, including outpatient clinics. One fatality and 3 near-fatalities were directly attributable to methemoglobinemia. Dapsone was the most common etiology of acquired methemoglobinemia, accounting for 42\% of all cases. The mean peak methemoglobin level among these individuals was 7.6\%. In 5 of the patients with the most severely elevated levels, 20\% benzocaine spray (Hurricaine Topical Anesthetic spray, Beutlich Pharmaceuticals, Waukegan, IL) was the etiology, associated with a mean peak methemoglobin level of 43.8\%. Eleven pediatric patients developed methemoglobinemia either from exogenous exposure, such as drugs, or due to serious illness, such as gastrointestinal infections with dehydration. Almost all (94\%) patients with methemoglobinemia were anemic. Drugs that cause acquired methemoglobinemia are ubiquitous in both the hospital and the outpatient setting. Acquired methemoglobinemia is a treatable condition that causes significant morbidity and even mortality. We hope that a heightened awareness of methemoglobinemia will result in improved recognition and treatment. Primary prevention efforts have the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of noninvasive real-time measurement of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) using a pulse CO-oximeter in victims of carbon monoxide poisoning (COP). METHODS: During the 7-month study period, pulse CO-oximetry was measured on patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected COP. Each patient included in the study underwent concomitant assessment of COHb by blood sampling and noninvasive pulse CO-oximetry (SpCO). RESULTS: Twelve non-smoker patients were included. Mean age was 40 +/- 17 years. No difference was found between the two COHb assessment techniques (p>0.05). Analysis using the Bland and Altman procedure suggested good alignment of the two techniques with a slight bias (i.e. -1.5\%) indicating slight overestimation by the pulse CO-oximeter. Analysis using the Passing and Bablok statistical protocol further documented the reliability of the two methods. CONCLUSION: This study documents the precision of the correlation between readings obtained with the noninvasive pulse CO-oximeter and COHb measurements from blood samples. This preliminary result demonstrates that this simple rapid noninvasive technology could be useful before and after arrival at the ED.},

abstract = {Fetal monitoring during labor aims to identify fetal problems which, if uncorrected, may result in morbidity or death. A nonreassuring or abnormal fetal heart rate trace by cardiotocography (CTG) does not necessarily equate with fetal hypoxia and/or acidosis. However, in the absence of more objective data, the use of CTG often results in variable, but inappropriately high, operative delivery rates (forceps, vacuum, or cesarean delivery) for nonreassuring fetal status in many hospitals. The addition of fetal pulse oximetry (FPO) has the potential to improve the assessment of fetal well-being during labor. In this review we consider several aspects of FPO. Several factors, such as sensor to skin contact, uterine contractions, fetal hair, and caput succedaneum, influence the performance and use of FPO. Issues such as clinicians' perspectives of FPO sensor placement, maternal perspectives of FPO during labor, and an economic analysis have all favored FPO. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of FPO reported a reduction in cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal status when FPO was added to conventional CTG monitoring, with no difference in overall cesarean delivery rates. One large RCT reported no difference in mode of birth for any indication. Several issues relevant to the future of FPO have been addressed by these RCTs, the major issue being that it makes no difference to cesarean rates. It may be argued that FPO has a valid clinical use in monitoring the fetus with congenital heart block. Additionally, in situations of nonreassuring fetal status and dystocia, FPO may provide the necessary reassurance until adequate resources for cesarean delivery are available.},

@article{Toffaletti2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: We describe some misconceptions that have become common practice in reporting blood gas and cooximetry results. In 1980, oxygen saturation was incorrectly redefined in a report of a new instrument for analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) derivatives. Oxygen saturation (sO2) was redefined as the ratio of oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) to total Hb instead of the ratio of O2Hb to active Hb (O2Hb + desoxyhemoglobin). In addition, the new terms "functional saturation" and "fractional saturation" were introduced. Since the new parameter was implemented in a widely used cooximeter, its use is now widespread and has caused misunderstandings. METHODS: In this report, we review the development of the definitions and measurements of sO2 and related quantities and contend that the misconceptions should be resolved by standardizing instrument read-outs and clinical reports, so that sO2, defined as the ratio of O2Hb to active Hb, should replace FO2Hb and be reported along with the total Hb concentration and the common dyshemoglobin fractions (\%CO-Hb and \% methemoglobin [metHb]). RESULTS: The redefinition of sO2 as the \%O2Hb or FO2Hb did not address the confusion that might result from interchanging these two often-similar but different terms. The term fractional saturation is an inappropriate terminology and lacks clear physiological meaning. We see frequent cases of confusion: (a) the difference between the sO2 in pulse oximetry and the FO2Hb in cooximetry is called the "pulse oximeter gap;" (b) sO2 results are described as "method dependent;" and (c) reference ranges for these terms are substituted. CONCLUSIONS: Although either parameter could be used by clinicians who fully understand the relatively simple difference between these parameters, we find clear evidence that there is widespread confusion of these terms, even among experts in the field. Standardization of the reporting format would help, and instrument manufacturers could contribute by standardizing the reporting format for cooximetry results.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish normal values for overnight oxygen saturation (SpO2) in healthy term infants using an oximeter which takes into account motion artifacts and to compare these to normal values collected with a previous generation oximeter not correcting for motion artifacts. We recorded overnight SpO2 in 26 term, healthy infants (median age 136 days, range 6-364 days) in the home environment using the Nellcor Symphony N 3000 pulse oximeter with an averaging time of 3 s. A sample rate of 5 s was chosen. Motion artifacts were excluded from the analysis. Data were compared with those from a previous study, using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria with the Oxford Medilog. Median (quartiles) SpO2 was 98\% (97\%-99\%). Median percentage of study time below SpO2 94\% was 0.2\% (0.1\%-0.7\%); median percentage of study time below SpO2 90\% was 0.0\% (0.0\%-0.01\%). Median SpO2with the Oxford oximeter was 97\% (96\%-98\%); percentage of study time below SpO2 94\% was 8\% (2\%-14\%); percentage of study time below SpO2 90\% was 2\% (0\%-4\%). These data were compared with the Nellcor Symphony data: differences in median SpO2 were significant ( P<0.05); differences in percentage of time below SpO2 94\% and 90\% were also statistically significant ( P<0.001). CONCLUSION: we established normal values of oxygen saturation in healthy term infants using the Nellcor Symphony 3000 pulse oximeter. Care should be taken in interpreting values obtained with different types of pulse oximeters.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methemoglobin in the blood cannot be detected by conventional pulse oximetry and may bias the oximeter's estimate (Spo(2)) of the true arterial functional oxygen saturation (Sao(2)). A recently introduced "pulse CO-oximeter" (Masimo Rainbow SET® Radical-7) that measures SpMet, a noninvasive measurement of the percentage of methemoglobin in arterial blood (\%MetHb), was shown to read spuriously high values during hypoxia. In this study we sought to determine whether the manufacturer's modifications have improved the device's ability to detect and accurately measure methemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin simultaneously. METHODS: Twelve healthy adult volunteer subjects were fitted with sensors on the middle finger of each hand, and a radial arterial catheter was placed for blood sampling. Intravenous administration of ∼300 mg of sodium nitrite elevated subjects' methemoglobin levels to a 7\% to 11\% target level, and hypoxia was induced to different levels of Sao(2) (70\% to 100\%) by varying fractional inspired oxygen. Pulse CO-oximeter readings were compared with arterial blood values measured with a Radiometer ABL800 FLEX multi-wavelength oximeter. Pulse CO-oximeter methemoglobin reading performance was analyzed by the bias (SpMet-\%MetHb), and by observing the incidence of meaningful reading errors and predictive value at the various hypoxia levels. Spo(2) bias (Spo(2)--Sao(2)), precision, and root-mean-square error were evaluated during conditions of elevated methemoglobin. RESULTS: Observations spanned 74\% to 100\% Sao(2) and 0.4\% to 14.4\% methemoglobin with 307 blood draws and 602 values from the 2 oximeters. Masimo methemoglobin reading bias and precision over the full Sao(2) span was 0.16\% and 0.83\%, respectively, and was similar across the span. Masimo Spo(2) readings were biased -1.93\% across the 70\% to 100\% Sao(2) range. CONCLUSIONS: The Rainbow's methemoglobin readings are acceptably accurate over an oxygen saturation range of 74\%-100\% and a methemoglobin range of 0\%-14\%.},

abstract = {The underlying science of pulse oximetry is based on a simple manipulation of the Lambert-Beer law, which describes the attenuation of light traveling through a mixture of absorbers. Signals from detected red and infrared light that has traveled through blood-perfused tissues are used to estimate the underlying arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation. However, light scatters in tissue and influences some of the simplifications made in determining this relationship. Under most clinical circumstances, the empirical process that manufacturers use to calibrate the system during its design readily accommodates this and results in accurate readings. The same tissue light scattering properties allow sensors to be configured for use on opposing or adjacent surfaces, provided that the placement sites offer sufficient signal strength and are absent factors known to influence accuracy. In this paper I review the light-tissue interaction in pulse oximetry and describe some of the assumptions made and their implications. Certain deviations from the nominal conditions, whether clinical in nature or misuse of the product, can affect system performance. Consequently, users should be cautious in modifying sensors and/or using them on tissue sites not intended by the manufacturer (off-label use). While perhaps helpful for obtaining pulsatile signals or extending the lifetime of a sensor, some practices can disrupt the optical integrity of the measurement and negatively impact the oxygen saturation reading accuracy.},

abstract = {Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) analysis was introduced in the early 1980s using locally heated electrochemical sensors that were applied to the skin surface. This methodology provides a continuous noninvasive estimation of the arterial CO2 value and can be used for assessing adequacy of ventilation. The technique is now established and used routinely in clinical practice. Transcutaneous partial pressure of CO2 (tcPco2) sensors are available as a single Pco2 sensor, as a combined Pco2/Po2 sensor, and more recently, as a combined Pco2/Spo2 sensor. CO2 is still measured potentiometrically by determining the pH of an electrolyte layer. The methodology has been continuously developed during the last 20 yr, making the tcPco2 systems easier and more reliable for use in clinical practice: smaller sensor size (diameter 15 mm, height 8 mm), less frequent sensor re-membraning (every 2 wk) and calibration (twice a day), sensor ready to use when connected to the monitor, lower sensor temperature (42 degrees C), shorter arterialization time (3 min), and increased measurement reliability through protection of the membrane. The present tcPco2 sensors still need to be regularly re-membraned and calibrated. One way to overcome these procedures is to use optical-only detection means. Two techniques have been developed using optical absorption in the near-infrared light, in the evanescent wave of a waveguide integrated in the sensor surface, or in a micro-optics sampling cell. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo CO2 measurements have been performed. The sensor is not affected by drift over several days, and its response time is <1 min.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent advances in pulse oximetry have made it possible to noninvasively measure total hemoglobin, as well as the two most common dyshemoglobins. This review will trace the development and clinical application of multiwavelength pulse oximetry. RECENT FINDINGS: Until now, commercially produced pulse oximeters have utilized two wavelengths of light and could measure only the ratio of oxyhemoglobin to total hemoglobin, displayed as SpO2. Pulse oximeters using up to 12 light wavelengths have recently been developed by Masimo Corp. (Irvine, California, USA). These new 'Rainbow Pulse CO-oximeter' instruments can estimate blood levels of carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and total hemoglobin (SpHb), as well as the conventional SpO2 value. The accuracy of these new measurements has been studied in human volunteers and clinical trials. Some interesting case reports have documented the use of this new technology in diagnosis and treatment. SUMMARY: The development of multiwavelength pulse oximeters, which can measure total hemoglobin as well as dyshemoglobins, should result in improved patient care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A new eight-wavelength pulse oximeter is designed to measure methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, in addition to the usual measurements of hemoglobin oxygen saturation and pulse rate. This study examines this device's ability to measure dyshemoglobins in human volunteers in whom controlled levels of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin are induced. METHODS: Ten volunteers breathed 500 ppm carbon monoxide until their carboxyhemoglobin levels reached 15\%, and 10 different volunteers received intravenous sodium nitrite, 300 mg, to induce methemoglobin. All were instrumented with arterial cannulas and six Masimo Rad-57 (Masimo Inc., Irvine, CA) pulse oximeter sensors. Arterial blood was analyzed by three laboratory CO-oximeters, and the resulting carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin measurements were compared with the corresponding pulse oximeter readings. RESULTS: The Rad-57 measured carboxyhemoglobin with an uncertainty of +/-2\% within the range of 0-15\%, and it measured methemoglobin with an uncertainty of 0.5\% within the range of 0-12\%. CONCLUSION: The Masimo Rad-57 is the first commercially available pulse oximeter that can measure methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, and it therefore represents an expansion of our oxygenation monitoring capability.},

abstract = {The performance of three commercially available pulse oximeters was assessed in five anesthetized dogs in which increasing levels of methemoglobin were induced. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation in each dog was monitored with three pulse oximeters (Nellcor N-100(R), Ohmeda 3700(R), and Novametrix 500(R)) and a mixed venous saturation pulmonary artery catheter (Oximetrix Opticath(R)). Arterial and mixed venous blood specimens were analyzed for Pao2, Paco2, and pH, using standard electrodes. An IL-282 Co-oximeter was used on the same specimens to determine oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin as percentages of total hemoglobin. Methemoglobin levels of up to 60$\backslash$\% were induced by intratracheal benzocaine. As MetHb gradually increased while the dogs were breathing 100$\backslash$\% inspired oxygen, the pulse oximeter saturation (Spo2) overestimated the fractional oxygen saturation (Sao2) by an amount proportional to the concentration of methemoglobin until the latter reached approximately 35$\backslash$\%. At this level the Spo2 values reached a plateau of 84-86$\backslash$\% and did not decrease further. When, at fixed methemoglobin levels, additional hemoglobin desaturation was induced by reducing inspired oxygen fraction, Spo2 changed by much less than did Sao2 (regression slopes from 0.16 to 0.32). Thus, at high methemoglobin levels Spo2 tends to overestimate Sao2 by larger amounts at low hemoglobin saturations. Plots of Spo2 versus functional saturation (oxyhemoglobin/reduced hemoglobin plus oxyhemoglobin) show an improved but still poor relationship (regression slopes from 0.32 to 0.46). The Oximetrix Opticath pulmonary artery catheter behaves similarly but provides somewhat better agreement with functional saturation than do the pulse oximeters in the presence of methemoglobinemia. Pulse oximetry data (Spo2) should be used with caution in patients with methemoglobinemia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methemoglobin in the blood cannot be detected by conventional pulse oximetry, although it can bias the oximeter's estimate (Spo2) of the true arterial functional oxygen saturation (Sao2). A recently introduced "Pulse CO-Oximeter" (Masimo Rainbow SET(R) Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter, Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA) is intended to additionally monitor noninvasively the fractional carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin content in blood. The purpose of our study was to determine whether hypoxia affects the new device's estimated methemoglobin reading accuracy, and whether the presence of methemoglobin impairs the ability of the Radical-7 and a conventional pulse oximeter (Nonin 9700, Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN) to detect decreases in Sao2. METHODS: Eight and 6 healthy adults were included in 2 study groups, respectively, each fitted with multiple sensors and a radial arterial catheter for blood sampling. In the first group, IV administration of approximately 300 mg sodium nitrite increased subjects' methemoglobin level to a 7\% to 8\% target and hypoxia was induced to different levels of Sao2 (70\%-100\%) by varying fractional inspired oxygen. In the second group, 15\% methemoglobin at room air and 80\% Sao2 were targeted. Pulse CO-oximeter readings were compared with arterial blood values measured using a Radiometer multiwavelength hemoximeter. Pulse CO-oximeter methemoglobin reading performance was analyzed by observing the incidence of meaningful reading errors at the various hypoxia levels. This was used to determine the impact on predictive values for detecting methemoglobinemia. Spo2 reading bias, precision, and root mean square error were evaluated during conditions of elevated methemoglobin. RESULTS: Observations spanned 66.2\% to 99\% Sao2 and 0.6\% to 14.4\% methemoglobin over the 2 groups (170 blood draws). Masimo methemoglobin reading bias and precision over the full Sao2 span was 7.7\% +/- 13.0\%. Best accuracy was found in the 95\% to 100\% Sao2 range (1.9\% +/- 2.5\%), progressing to its worst in the 70\% to 80\% range (24.8\% +/- 15.6\%). Occurrence of methemoglobin readings in error >5\% increased over each 5-point decrease in Sao2 (P < 0.05). Masimo Spo2 readings were biased -6.3\% +/- 3.0\% in the 95\% to 100\% Sao2 range with 4\% to 8.3\% methemoglobin. Both the Radical-7 and Nonin 9700 pulse oximeters accurately detected decreases in Sao(2) <90\% with 4\% to 15\% methemoglobin, despite displaying low Spo2 readings when Sao2 was >95\%. CONCLUSIONS: The Radical-7's methemoglobin readings become progressively more inaccurate as Sao2 decreases <95\%, at times overestimating true values by 10\% to 40\%. Elevated methemoglobin causes the Spo2 readings to underestimate Sao2 similar to conventional 2-wavelength pulse oximeters at high saturation. Spo2 readings from both types of instruments continue to trend downward during the development of hypoxemia (Sao2 <90\%) with methemoglobin levels up to 15\%.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although pulse oximetry is currently in widespread use, there are few data documenting improvement in patient outcome as a result of the use of oximetry. The authors describe the study design, patient demographic findings, data validation, pulse oximetry failure rate, and overall postoperative complication rates in the first large prospective randomized multicenter clinical trial on perioperative pulse oximetry monitoring. METHODS: In five Danish hospitals, by random assignment, monitoring did or did not include pulse oximetry for patients 18 yr of age and older, whether scheduled for elective or emergency operations, or for regional or general anesthesia, except during cardiac and neurosurgical procedures. Operational definitions were established for perioperative events and postoperative complications. The data were collected preoperatively, during anesthesia, in the postanesthesia care unit, and until the day of discharge from the hospital or the seventh postoperative day. RESULTS: Of 20,802 patients, 10,312 were assigned to the oximetry group and 10,490, to the control group. In general, the demographic data, patient factors, and anesthetic agents used were distributed evenly. A slight intergroup difference was found in the distribution of age, duration of surgery, some types of surgery, and some types of anesthesia. The total failure rate of the oximetry was 2.5\%, but it increased to 7.2\% in patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 4 (P < 0.00001). In 14.9\% of the patients, one or more events occurred in the operating room and 13.5\% in the postanesthesia care unit. The overall postoperative complication rate was 9.7\%. The total rates of cardiovascular and respiratory complications were 2.78\% and 3.50\%, respectively. Within the first seven postoperative days, 0.47\% of the patients died. Anesthesia was not thought to have been solely responsible for any death, but in 7 patients (1 per 3,365), it was a possible contributory factor. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the finding of a few significant inter-group differences, the randomization was well balanced with a high validity of data. The overall postoperative complication rate was similar to that in other recent morbidity and mortality studies.},

This article reviews the principles of pulse oximetry, with an eye toward recognizing the limitations of this tool. Among these are performance limitations in the settings of carboxyhemoglobinemia, methemoglobinemia, motion artifact, hypotension, vasoconstriction, and anemia. The accuracy of pulse oximetry is discussed in light of these factors, with further discussion of applications for pulse oximetry in emergency medicine, including both oximetric and plethysmographic operation. The pulse oximeter is an invaluable instrument for emergency medicine practice, but as with any test the data it offers must be critically appraised for proper interpretation and utilization.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pulse oximetry may overestimate arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (Sao2) at low Sao2 levels in individuals with darkly pigmented skin, but other factors, such as gender and oximeter probe type, remain less studied. METHODS: We studied the relationship between skin pigment and oximeter accuracy in 36 subjects (19 males, 17 females) of a range of skin tones. Clip-on type sensors and adhesive/disposable finger probes for the Masimo Radical, Nellcor N-595, and Nonin 9700 were studied. Semisupine subjects breathed air-nitrogen-CO2 mixtures via a mouthpiece to rapidly achieve 2- to 3-min stable plateaus of Sao2. Comparisons of Sao2 measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) with Sao2 (by Radiometer OSM-3) were used in a multivariate model to assess the source of errors. RESULTS: The mean bias (Spo2 - Sao2) for the 70\%-80\% saturation range was 2.61\% for the Masimo Radical with clip-on sensor, -1.58\% for the Radical with disposable sensor, 2.59\% for the Nellcor clip, 3.6\% for the Nellcor disposable, -0.60\% for the Nonin clip, and 2.43\% for the Nonin disposable. Dark skin increased bias at low Sao2; greater bias was seen with adhesive/disposable sensors than with the clip-on types. Up to 10\% differences in saturation estimates were found among different instruments in dark-skinned subjects at low Sao2. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate analysis indicated that Sao2 level, sensor type, skin color, and gender were predictive of errors in Spo2 estimates at low Sao2 levels. The data suggest that clinically important bias should be considered when monitoring patients with saturations below 80\%, especially those with darkly pigmented skin; but further study is needed to confirm these observations in the relevant populations.},

The symptoms are often non-specific or masked by an exacerbation of an underlying illness, such as congestive heart failure, that has been triggered by carbon monoxide inhalation. The effects can range from mild, annoying symptoms relieved by removal of the source to severe morbidity with profound central nervous system dysfunction, acute complications and delayed sequelae. Estimates suggest that about one-third of nonfatal cases of carbon monoxide poisoning go undetected and undiagnosed. We present a case of residential carbon monoxide poisoning to illustrate these points and to demonstrate the usefulness of a simple tool based on the CH2OPD2 mnemonic (Community, Home, Hobbies, Occupation, Personal habits, Diet and Drugs) that physicians can use to obtain an environmental exposure history.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Carbon monoxide (CO) toxicity is a significant health problem. The use of non-invasive pulse CO-oximetry screening in the emergency department has demonstrated that the rapid screening of numerous individuals for CO toxicity is simple and capable of identifying occult cases of CO toxicity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to extend the use of this handheld device to the prehospital arena, assess carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) levels in emergency medical services (EMS) patients, and correlate these levels with clinical and demographic data. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, chart review of adult patients transported to hospital emergency departments by urban fire department EMS ambulances during a six-week period. Each ambulance used a non-invasive pulse CO-oximeter (Rad-57, Masimo Inc.) to record patients' COHb concentrations (SpCO) along with the standard EMS assessment data. Spearman's Rank Correlation tests and Student's t-tests were used to analyze the data and calculate relationships between SpCO and other variables (age, gender, respiratory rate, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry). RESULTS: A total of 36.4\% of the patients transported during the study had SpCO documented. Of the 1,017 adults included in this group, 11 (1.1\%) had an SpCO >15\%. There was no correlation between SpCO and heart rate, ventilatory rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for CO toxicity in the EMS setting is possible, and may aid in the early detection and treatment of CO-poisoned patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the use of pulse oximeters increases, the needs for higher performance and wider applicability of pulse oximetry have increased. To realize the full potential of pulse oximetry, it is indispensable to increase the number of optical wavelengths. To develop a multiwavelength oximetry system, a physical theory of pulse oximetry must be constructed. In addition, a theory for quantitative measurement of optical absorption in an optical scatterer, such as in living tissue, remains a difficult theoretical and practical aspect of this problem. METHODS: We adopted Schuster's theory of radiation through a foggy atmosphere for a basis of theory of pulse oximetry. We considered three factors affecting pulse oximetry: the optics, the tissue, and the venous blood. RESULTS: We derived a physical theoretical formula of pulse oximetry. The theory was confirmed with a full SO2 range experiment. Based on the theory, the three-wavelength method eliminated the effect of tissue and improved the accuracy of Spo2. The five-wavelength method eliminated the effect of venous blood and improved motion artifact elimination. CONCLUSIONS: Our theory of multiwavelength pulse oximetry can be expected to be useful for solving almost all problems in pulse oximetry such as accuracy, motion artifact, low-pulse amplitude, response delay, and errors using reflection oximetry which will expand the application of pulse oximetry. Our theory is probably a rare case of success in solving the difficult problem of quantifying optical density of a substance embedded in an optically scattering medium.},

METHODS: COHb was measured using a new noninvasive pulse CO-oximeter (Rad-57, Masimo, Irvine, California) in 38 subjects entering a bingo hall where smoking was allowed, then again as they exited 3 hours later. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD baseline COHb for the entire group was 3.3 +/- 1.8\%, for the 23 nonsmokers it was 2.2 +/- 0.7\%, and for the 15 smokers it was 4.9 +/- 1.9\%. The nonsmokers' mean COHb was unchanged, at 2.2 +/- 0.8\%, whereas the smokers' mean COHb fell to 3.2 +/- 1.9\%. CONCLUSIONS: The nonsmokers were not significantly exposed to CO from secondhand smoke in the setting we tested. The smokers probably consumed fewer cigarettes while playing bingo than they did prior to arrival. The Rad-57 pulse CO-oximeter is easy to use in the ambulatory setting.},

It follows that applying signal processing techniques to pulse oximetry could also provide major improvements. This research was designed to identify and implement one or more techniques that could improve pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements. The hypothesis was that frequency domain analysis could more easily extract the cardiac rate and amplitude of interest from the time domain signal. The focus was on the digital signal processing algorithms that had potential to improve pulse oximetry readings, and then test those algorithms. This was accomplished using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The results indicate that the FFT and DCT computation of oxygen saturation were as accurate without averaging, as weighted moving average (WMA) algorithms currently being used, and directly indicate when erroneous calculations occur.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pulse oximetry is now a ubiquitous and essential tool of modern medicine, and while it is a relatively recent invention, the technology has rapidly matured since the first commercially available oximeters were introduced in the 1970s. This review seeks to provide an overview of the basic physical operation of the probe and discuss its limitations, sources of error and some current advances in the use of multi-wavelength probes. RECENT FINDINGS: New multi-wavelength oximeters and plethysmographic waveform analysis may expand the information that we can collect and use non-invasively. This includes distinguishing between haemoglobinopathies, monitoring volume status and volume loss, and potentially monitoring cardiac output non-invasively. SUMMARY: The pulse oximeter, like any basic tool, must be used properly. There is considerable misunderstanding and lack of education among junior clinicians as to the use and interpretation of pulse oximeters. The introduction of the pulse oximeter has demonstrated a cost saving, although the cost-benefit of new multi-wavelength probes remains unproven.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We assess agreement between carboxyhemoglobin levels measured by the Rad-57 signal extraction pulse CO-oximeter (RAD), a Food and Drug Administration-approved device for noninvasive bedside measurement, and standard laboratory arterial or venous measurement in a sample of emergency department (ED) patients with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional cohort design using a convenience sample of adult and pediatric ED patients in a Level I trauma, burn, and hyperbaric oxygen referral center. Measurement of RAD carboxyhemoglobin was performed simultaneously with blood sampling for laboratory determination of carboxyhemoglobin level. The difference between the measures for each patient was calculated as laboratory carboxyhemoglobin minus carboxyhemoglobin from the carbon monoxide oximeter. The limits of agreement from a Bland-Altman analysis are calculated as the mean of the differences between methods +/-1.96 SDs above and below the mean. RESULTS: Median laboratory percentage carboxyhemoglobin level was 2.3\% (interquartile range 1 to 8.5; range 0\% to 38\%). The mean difference between laboratory carboxyhemoglobin values and RAD values was 1.4\% carboxyhemoglobin (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.2\% to 2.6\%). The limits of agreement of differences of measurement made with the 2 devices were -11.6\% and 14.4\% carboxyhemoglobin. This range exceeded the value of +/-5\% carboxyhemoglobin defined a priori as clinically acceptable. RAD correctly identified 11 of 23 patients with laboratory values greater than 15\% carboxyhemoglobin (sensitivity 48\%; 95\% CI 27\% to 69\%). There was one case of a laboratory carboxyhemoglobin level less than 15\%, in which the RAD device gave a result greater than 15\% (specificity of RAD 96/97=99\%; 95\% CI 94\% to 100\%). CONCLUSION: In the range of carboxyhemoglobin values measured in this sample, the level of agreement observed suggests RAD measurement may not be used interchangeably with standard laboratory measurement.},

Compounding these differences is a lack of uniform characterization of motion, and the consequential effects of motion upon the wide range of normal and abnormal human physiology. Traditional motion testing attempts to standardize motion into a reproducible form by using a mechanical jig to produce passive motion of a known amplitude and frequency. This type of motion challenge fails to account for the physiologic changes induced by active movement.},
