  abstract={An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to classify photoelectric plethysmographic (PPG) pulse waveforms for the diagnosis of lower limb peripheral vascular disease (PVD). PPG pulses from the lower limbs, and pre- and post-exercise Doppler ultrasound ankle to brachial systolic blood pressure ratio measurements were obtained from patients referred to a vascular investigation laboratory. A single PPG pulse from the big toe of each leg was processed and normalized, and used as input data to the ANN. The ANN outputs represented the diagnostic classifications (normal, significant PVD and major PVD) and the ANN was trained with the ankle to brachial pressure indices (ABPI). The back-propagation learning algorithm was used to train the ANN for 500 epochs with a PPG training set of pulses from 100 legs. The results of this study indicate that a neural network can be trained to distinguish between PPG pulses from normal and diseased lower limb arteries.}

  abstract = {The effects of fluorescein, methylene blue, and indocyanine green on hemodynamic variables and on pulse oximetry and co-oximetry measurements of arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) and oxyhemoglobin percentage (\% HbO2) were evaluated in 16 anesthetized dogs in vitro by co-oximetry (\% HbO2) and in vivo by pulse oximetry (SaO2). The light absorbance (optical density) in plasma (range 500 to 800 nm) was measured by a spectrophotometer. Fluorescein did not affect oximetry measurements, plasma light absorbance in the range measured, or hemodynamic variables. Methylene blue caused dose-dependent decreases in measurements made with both forms of oximetry for up to 30 minutes, the decrease being greater and longer lasting with pulse oximetry (P less than 0.05). Hemodynamic measurements in 5 dogs showed that methylene blue (1 to 5 mg/kg) increased arterial pressure transiently, after which cardiac output, stroke index, and left ventricular stroke work index decreased and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances increased (P less than 0.05 with 5 mg/kg). Methemoglobin concentration measured by co-oximetry increased significantly (to 19.9 +/- 1.4\%, P less than 0.05) 1 minute after 5 mg/kg of methylene blue was injected. Methylene blue had a dose- and time-dependent effect on plasma light absorbance, and this effect peaked in the 660- to 670-nm range. The data do not distinguish the relative contributions of physiology (hemodynamic change), chemistry (methemoglobin production), and physics (optical properties) to the decrease in pulse oximetry and co-oximetry measurements that follows injection of methylene blue. Indocyanine green affected neither hemodynamic variables nor co-oximetry readings but decreased pulse oximetry readings for up to 10 minutes dose dependently.},

  year = {1987},
  abstract = {Five dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated with various mixtures of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. Each dog was monitored with arterial and pulmonary artery catheters, a transcutaneous Po2 analyzer, and two pulse oximeters. An IL-282 Co-oximeter was used to periodically measure arterial oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) as percentages of the total hemoglobin. The Pao2, Paco2, and pH were measured in the same blood specimens using standard electrodes. When the inspired oxygen concentration was reduced in the absence of COHb, the pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) estimated O2Hb with reasonable accuracy. COHb levels were then varied slowly from 0-75\% in each dog. As the COHb level increased and oxyhemoglobin decreased, both pulse oximeters continued to read an oxygen saturation of greater than 90\%, while the actual O2Hb fell below 30\%. In the presence of COHb, the SpO2 is approximately the sum of COHb and O2Hb, and, thus, may seriously overestimate O2Hb. The pulse oximeter, as the sole indicator of blood oxygenation, should, therefore, be used with caution in patients with recent carbon monoxide exposure. On the other hand, transcutaneous Po2 falls linearly as COHb increases, and reaches about one-fifth of its initial value at the highest COHb levels despite the maintenance of constant arterial Po2.},

abstract ={Noninvasive measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) by pulse oximetry is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important technological advances in monitoring clinical patients. Pulse oximeters compute SaO2 by measuring differences in the visible and near infrared absorbances of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated arterial blood. Unlike clinical blood gas analyzers, which require a sample of blood from the patient and can provide only intermittent measurement of patient oxygenation, pulse oximeters provide continuous, safe, and instantaneous measurement of blood oxygenation. Here I review the theoretical background behind this advanced technology, instrumentation requirements, practical instrument calibration, common features of commercial pulse oximeters, specific clinical applications, and performance limitations of pulse oximeters.},
