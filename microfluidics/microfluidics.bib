This not only increases the driving force behind the lateral flow, but allows for the formation of advection patterns that cannot be created with structures on the bottom alone. Chevrons, pointing in opposite directions on the top and bottom, are used to create a pair of vortices positioned side by side. Stripes running the width of the channel generate a pair of vertically stacked vortices. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to model the behavior of the systems and provide velocity maps at cross-sections within the mixer. Experiments demonstrate the mixing that results when two segregated species enter the mixer side-by-side and pass through two cycles of the mixer (i.e., two alternating sets of four stripes and four chevrons).},

abstract={Rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria is very important within areas like food safety, medical diagnostics, hospital infection and biological warfare. Optical evanescent wave sensors are evolving to meet these challenges. Evanescent wave biosensors generate an electromagnetic wave at the sensor surface that penetrates 100-200 nm into the surrounding medium, which have proven to be a highly sensitive tool to monitor interactions in the close vicinity of the sensor surface. However, the use of such waveguides for bacterial detection is problematic for several reasons. These include the short penetration depth of the evanescent field of these waveguides (100-250 nm) compared to a typical size of a bacterium (1-5 mum), which places the majority of the bound cell outside the evanescent field. In addition, the low refractive index contrast between the bacterium cytoplasm and aqueous environments in which detection is usually performed, and availability and accessibility of antigens on the bacterium surface binding to the biorecognition elements. Finally, the sensor performance can for example be limited due to (i) mass transport of large analytes like bacteria which limits the binding to the immobilized recognition receptors, (ii) non-specific binding, and (iii) long analysis time. This article will focus on the development of deep-probe optical evanescent wave sensor such as metal clad leaky waveguide sensor for bacterial detection. In addition, two complete detection systems integrated with physical force fields to overcome these problems will be presented. These sensor systems are based on MCLW sensors and integrated with respectively an electric field and ultrasound standing waves as physical force to concentrate and enhance capturing of bacteria spores into immobilized antibodies on the sensor surface. The integration improves the detection limit by a few orders of magnitude and shortens the analysis time significantly.},

Metabolic processes in cells are briefly reviewed with the goal of quantifying the role of metabolites within the cell. Sensors reviewed include both research and commercial devices that can noninvasively detect extracellular metabolites, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and glucose. Metabolic activity can also be sensed nonselectively by measuring pH gradients. Performance metrics, such as sensitivity, sensor size, drift, time response, and sensing range, are included when available. Highly suitable sensor technologies for monitoring cellular metabolic activity include electrochemical sensors, scanning electrochemical microscopy, ion-sensitive field effect transistor sensors, and solid-state light-addressable potentiometric sensors. Other less-suitable, but still potentially viable, solid-state sensing technologies are also reviewed briefly, including resonant chemical sensors (surface acoustic wave and quartz crystal microbalance), conductivity or impedance sensors, and sensors with multiple transduction stages. Specific biological applications which benefit from detection of extracellular metabolic events at the single-cell level are discussed to provide context to the practical use of these sensor technologies; these applications include case studies of various diseases (cancer, diabetes, mitochondrial disorders. etc.), cell and tissue differentiation; cell and tissue storage; cell life cycle and basic cellular processes; and developmental biology.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is a bacterial foodborne pathogen responsible for listeriosis, an illness characterized by encephalitis, septicaemia , and meningitis. One of the best ways to detect and confrim the pathogen is through the detection of one of the virulence factors, listeriolysin O (LLO) produced by the microorganism. LLO is absolutely required for virulence by L. monocytogenes, and is found only in virulent strains of the species. This paper focuses on the electrical detection methods used to detect the LLO toxin gene in food products or organism. A new and simple electrochemical approach for hybridisation detection without the labelling the target DNA is described. The coupling of DNA electrochemical sensors have specialities of quick detection and cheapness and have the potential of the quantitative evaluation of the hlyA gene of Listeria monocytogenes. The electrochemical sensor was obtained by immobilizing single-stranded oligonucleotides onto gold electrodes through mercaptan of the DNA bases using N- hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) and N-(3-dimethylamion)propyl-N'-ethyl carbodiimidehydrochloride (EDC) as activation. The hybridization reaction that occurred on the electrode surface was evidenced by cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis - using as [Co(phen)3](C1O4)3 indicator. The covalently immobilized single-stranded DNA could selectively hybridize with its complementary DNA in solution to form double-stranded DNA on the gold surface. A significant increase of the peak current of cyclic voltammetry (CV) upon the hybridization of immobilized ssDNA with PCR amplification products in the solution was observed. This peak current change was used to monitor the amount of PCR amplification products. Factors such as DNA target concentration and hybridization conditions determining the sensitivity of the electrochemical assay were investigated.},

abstract={The advent of digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology offers a platform for developing diagnostic applications with the advantages of portability, increased automation, low-power consumption, compatibility with mass manufacturing, and high throughput. However, most digital microfluidic platforms incorporate limited optical capabilities (e.g., optical transmission) for integrated sensing, because more complex optical functions are difficult to integrate into the digital microfluidic platform. This follows since the sensor must be compatible with the hydrophobic surfaces on which electrowetting liquid transport occurs. With the emergence of heterogeneous photonic component integration technologies such as those described herein, the opportunity for integrating advanced photonic components has expanded considerably. Many diagnostic applications could benefit from the integration of more advanced miniaturized optical sensing technologies, such as index of refraction sensors (surface plasmon resonance sensors, microresonator sensors, etc.). The advent of these heterogeneous integration technologies, that enable the integration of thin-film semiconductor devices onto arbitrary host substrates, enables more complex optical functions, and in particular, planar optical systems, to be integrated into microfluidic systems. This paper presents an integrated optical sensor based upon the heterogeneous integration of an InGaAs-based thin-film photodetector with a digital microfluidic system. This demonstration of the heterogeneous integration and operation of an active optical thin-film device with a digital microfluidic system is the first step toward the heterogeneous integration of entire planar optical sensing systems on this platform.},

This new device works by direct contact of the PSAPD detector with the substrate layer of a microfluidic chip and provides 2- dimensional images of the distribution of beta emitting probes over time. The spatial resolution of the PSAPD detector for beta particle imaging was evaluated with 18F line sources. The FWHM was measured to be 0.4 mm at the center of the field of view. The sensitivity of the device for 18F beta particle detection was evaluated as a function of substrate thickness between the source and detector surface. One of the applications of this new detector system is for the imaging of live cell cultures in a microfluidic environment. Preliminary images have also been acquired showing the uptake of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) probes in live cells incubated in a microfluidic chamber. Images of [18F]FDG uptake were acquired with less than 200 incubated cells over a period of 3 days. An increase in cellular [18F]FDG uptake was also observed by increasing the time period between cell feeding and [18F]FDG incubation in the cell chamber.},

This approach obviates the need for capacitive sensing test-outcome circuits for analysis.

Faulty units on the chip will be marked and isolated from the array so that the remaining droplets can still be routed along a fault-free path to their destinations. This method guarantees a non-stop fault-tolerant operation for very large microfluidic arrays.},

The fluid mixing is based on the vertical mechanical vibration of membranes driven by PZT actuator. Tesla microvalves were built to eliminate the backward flow by increasing the unidirectional back pressure.

Microfluidic chips are an emerging technology that will facilitate the study of molecular processes in pico-liter levels in a finely controlled manner. The ability to quantify low amounts of radioactivity in a microfluidic chip will provide researchers with a platform to investigate molecular processes in a controlled in-vitro environment. The new detector system consists of a plastic scintillator, a C-mount compact lens, and a Sony ICX285AL interline-transfer CCD cooled with a Peltier device. A microfluidic chip filled with fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) solution was coupled to a plastic scintillator and the set up was placed inside a light-tight box for imaging. Preliminary studies were performed to test the feasibility of using the scintillator-based CCD detector system for this application. The CCD performance parameters were characterized by the photon transfer curve. The camera gain constant and read-out noise were measured to be 0.746 e-/ADU (analog-to-digital unit) and 8 e-, respectively. The dark current was also investigated with different temperatures and binning factors. The spatial resolution was measured and line pairs of FDG in a microfluidic chip were discernable down to a 0.5 mm separation. The system was able to quantify the activity level reliably down to 5 nCi/mm2.},

This novel pump is realized through the integration of a harmless strain of Escherichia coli cells with a MEMS-based microfluidic channel. In a free-moving state, each E. coli cell 'swims' by rotating its flagella, driven at the base by a rotary motor. When the cell is attached to a surface through a single shortened flagellar filament, the motor turns the whole cell body at a high rotational speed. Our micro pump utilizes this mechanism to transport liquid in a microfluidic channel through viscous pumping. This paper describes our effort in two critical areas in the pump development process: microfluidic flow simulations and cell tethering experiments in a micro channel.},

abstract={The growing number of chronic diseases such as cancer, the absence of specific and efficient treatments for several viral and bacterial diseases and the absence of efficient and fast method of environmental monitoring has created the need of rapid identification and diagnosis. Laboratory on-Chip (LoC) is an advanced method to produce real-time, multiple and highly sensitive analysis at the point-of-care, providing the results for physicians and patients. This multidisciplinary research approach calls for an integration of heterogeneous structures including microelectronic and microfluidic technologies as well as conventional biochemistry techniques. Standard CMOS process is an excellent candidate to realize such LoC systems offering the advantages of well-studied circuits and embedded sensors/actuators. This tutorial presents an overview of recent advances in the design and implementation of hybrid microfluidic CMOS systems for LoC applications. A CMOS-based LoC can be divided in three parts : microfluidic structure, biofunctionalized layers and microelectronic circuitry. The microfluidic structure is required to direct the fluid toward the sensing/actuating sites, the biofunctionalized layers are formed to transduce the biological quantities to electrical changes or vice versa. After a long period of research on biological and chemical aspects of LoC, now the microelectronic circuits and systems design emerges as critical. In this tutorial, a brief overview of proposed methods in the literature for microfluidic packaging, functionalized layer and the relevant applications are firstly described. Thereafter, the recent progresses in dedicated circuits and systems design are put forward. CMOS process by offering an array of addressable coils or electrodes can play an essential role to generate programmable electrical or magnetic fields for dielectrophoresis, or magnetic manipulations. On the other hand, through this technology several embedded sensing techniques can b- - e realized as reported in the literature. In this tutorial, the optical, thermal, ISFET, impedimetric and in particular capacitive sensors are presented for molecular/cellular applications.},

The proof-of-concept chip, which has a three-input combinatorial mixer with eight micro culture chambers, was monolithically fabricated utilizing the surface micromaching of parylene C (poly-para-xylylene C). By having several microfluidic "overpasses" to allow one microfluidic channel to cross over other microfluidic channels, the combinatorial mixer was able to simultaneously generate all the combinations of the input fluidic streams for output to the micro chambers. We verified that parylene C is a biocompatible substrate for cell culturing and also showed cell culturing inside the micro culture chambers. The feasibility of using the integrated combinatorial mixer for cell assaying was demonstrated with experiments using three different cell stains, and results showed the cells in different chambers were stained with varying color patterns.},

To maximize the adhesion difference, three types of polymeric nanostructures (50 nm pillars, 50 nm perpendicular and parallel lines with respect to the direction of flow) were fabricated using UV- assisted capillary moulding onto glass substrate of PDMS microfluidic channel. The adhesion force of human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) and human breast carcinoma (MCF7) was measured independently by injecting each cell line into the microfluidic device followed by culture for a period of time (e.g., one, two, and three hours). Then, the cells bound to the floor of a microfluidic channel were detached by increasing the flow rate of medium in a stepwise fashion. The adhesion force of MCF10A was always higher than that of MCF cells regardless of culture time and surface nanotopography at all flow rates, resulting in a label-free separation of cancer cells.

Using microfluidic technology to integrate and automate all these steps in a single chip device is highly desirable in many practical applications such as clinical diagnostic and in-field environmental testing. We have developed self-contained and fully integrated biochip systems for immunoassay and DNA analysis. These microfluidic biochip devices can perform detection of multiple bioagents (including antigens and DNA) using electrochemical detection methods. Microfluidic mixer, valves, pumps, channels, chambers, and Combimatrix microelectrode array are integrated to perform parallel immunoassays to detect infectious particles (viruses and bacteria) from complex biological samples in a single, fully automated biochip device. All microfluidic components use very simple and inexpensive approaches in order to reduce chip complexity. Back-end detection is accomplished using an enzyme-based electrochemical detection method that has many advantages including high sensitivity (∼fM) and simple apparatus. The sensor is a miniaturized array of individually addressable microelectrodes controlled by active CMOS circuitry. Pathogenic bacteria and DNA detections are both demonstrated. The devices with capabilities of on-chip sample processing and detection provide a cost-effective solution to direct sample-to-answer biological analysis for point-of-care genetic analysis, disease diagnosis, and in-field bio-threat detection.},

The microfluidic/microelectronic fabrication process yields identical, highly uniform, and geometrically well-defined microelectrodes embedded in a microchannel network. Each three-microelectrode system consists of a Au working electrode with a nominal surface area of 9 mum2, a Cl2 plasma-treated Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a Au counter electrode. The patterned electrodes on the glass substrate are aligned and irreversibly bonded with a PDMS microchannel network giving a channel volume of 72 nL. The electrokinetic properties and the diffusion profile of the microchannels are investigated under electrokinetic flow and pressure-driven flow conditions. Cyclic voltammetry of 10 mM K3 Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KNO3 demonstrates that the electrode responses in the cell are characterized by linear diffusion. The voltammograms show that the system is a quasi-reversible redox process, with heterogeneous rate constants ranging from 3.11 to 4.94times10-3 cm/s for scan rates of 0.1-1 V/s. The current response in the cell is affected by the adsorption of the electroactive species on the electrode surface. In a low-current DNA hybridization detection experiment, the electrode cell is modified with single-stranded thiolated DNA. The electrocatalytic reduction of 27 muM Ru(NH3)6 3+ in a solution containing 2 mM Fe(CN)6 3- is measured before and after the exposure of the electrode cell to a 500-nM target DNA sample.

It is also observed that the absorbance peaks of DNT (dinitrotoluene) and TNT are mutually independent and that the presence of DNT does not affect the detection of TNT. Electrowetting also does not seem to influence the colorimetric complex as observed from a comparison of results between a spectrophotometer and on-chip.},

abstract={We previously demonstrated application of a MEMS electrochemical biosensor to detect pathogenic bacteria in urine. Using custom-designed DNA oligonucleotide probes specific for bacterial 16S rRNA, species-specific detection was achieved within 45 minutes. However, the urine sample preparation protocol is still a labor-intensive 7 to 10 step process. This paper outlines our initial efforts to develop PDMS-based pump and mixer designs compatible with our existing electrochemical biosensor. The eventual goal is to use these preliminary designs and numerical and experimental test results from various microfluidic components in PDMS in order to build an integrated lab-on-a-chip for rapid bacterial pathogen detection. Preliminary active mixing tests show at a four-fold improvement in the resulting electrochemical signal amplitude, when compared to flow through the microfluidic structure without mixing, as well as when compared to manual mixing.},

abstract={A nanoscale semiconducting ZnO based biosensor with integrated microfluidics is designed, fabricated and tested to demonstrate the detection of streptavidin, a commonly used protein. Amperometric (I-t) measurement is utilized to detect the change of conductivity over time. By comparing with the control experiment, the specific binding event between biotin and streptavidin is detected. The data indicates a conductivity change by more than 20% after the protein hybridization. The second part of the papers presents a ZnO thin film based biosensor which is integated with a microfluidic system. Same experiment protocols are carried and similar change in I-t characteristics is observed. This is the first demonstration of real time biosensing with ZnO nanowires and thin films that are integrated with microfluidic systems. This can be further extended to fabricate bio-sensors which can potentially detect any protein in real time. Amperometric sensing results in a label-free detection system as it detects the protein hybridization events electrically. when integrated on the system-on-package (SOP) platform, this technology can lead to portable, reliable and cost effective biosensors with applications in many areas.},

In the proposed device, dengue-2 RNA-virus was synthesized to complementary DNA (cDNA) and replicated using a RT-PCR module and then transported by a pneumatic micropump to CE sample reservoir. The cDNA samples were separated electrophoretically and detected by buried optical fibers. We have successfully demonstrated the detection of a RNA-virus using less time and less consumption of samples and reagents.

Magnetic bead-based immunoassay, as a typical example of biochemical detection and analysis, has been successfully performed on the integrated microfluidic biochemical analysis system that includes a surface-mounted biofilter and immunosensor on a glass microfluidic motherboard. Total time required for full immunoassay was less than 20 minutes including sample incubation time and sample volume wasted was less than 50 μl during five repeated assays.

abstract={Summary form only given. A microfluidic chip has been developed which allows for the direct detection of several distinct DNA targets present in a sample. The direct detection of underivatized DNA is advantageous for the analysis of very small amounts of sample, where contamination is a major concern. DNA probes can be attached in microchannels present on the chip via a biotin/avidin linkage. The sample is then introduced into the channel where an appropriate DNA target hybridizes with its complementary probe. Following hybridization of the target, an alkaline buffer is introduced to the channel to dehybridize the double-stranded DNA and flush the target downstream to a copper electrode. The dehybridized DNA is then detected electrochemically. The elution time can be used to identify the particular DNA target since the DNA probes are spatially segregated in the channel. Integrating the detector and the sensing probes on the microfluidic chip allows for an inexpensive and easily fabricated biosensor device for the precise recognition and subsequent detection of a specific complimentary DNA target for diagnosis and genetic screening },
